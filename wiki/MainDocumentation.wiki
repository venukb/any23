#summary Preliminary documentation for Any23

This is some preliminary documentation for the [http://code.google.com/p/any23 Any23 (Anything To Triples)] library.

= Using Any23 as a library in your own applications =

See the getText(...) method of com.google.code.any23.Rover for an example.

= Using Any23 on the command line =

The rover script can be used to fetch a file from the Web and convert it to RDF using the Any23 library. Use it like this:

{{{rover http://twitter.com/cygri N3}}}

= Starting a local Any23 server =

You can start a local instance of the Any23 servlet for testing purposes. To do this, run the `server` script from the root directory of Any23. This will start a server (Jetty) on `localhost`, port 8080. You can access it like this:

http://localhost:8080/any23/n3/http://twitter.com/cygri

= Using the Any23 servlet in your own servlet container =

The Ant target `war` creates a WAR file that you can deploy to your own servlet container.
