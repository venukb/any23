#summary What to expect in the next versions of Any23

= Version 0.1 — Released on 14 January 2008 =

The goal is to have an initial open-source release of the “RDFizer” component developed for Sindice. Focus is on getting the code in shape for publication, creating initial documentation, setting up the project infrastructure and so on. No work on features is planned.

= Version 0.2 — Planned for 9 February 2008 =

For all core tasks, this version should be superior to what a developer could cobble together in a day or two. Developers will thus have a good reason to use any23: It saves them time. This version should be good enough to for all our internal purposes: replacing the Sindice RDFizer and replacing Jürgen's MetaX.

  * Better API
    * Allow streaming output
    * Allow choosing which extractors to use
    * Deliver results grouped by extractor/entity instead of one big RDF model
    * For microformat extractors: Track each entity's position in the DOM tree
  * Integrate MetaX (which includes Aperture; check licenses for compatibility first!)
  * Switch RDF library from Jena to Sesame
  * Alignment of the microformat mappings to [http://semanticweb.org/wiki/Microformats_in_RDF the official ones]
  * Integrate W3C's RDFa test suite and pass all tests
  * Switch MIME type detection to Apache Tika
  * Add test suite for MIME type detection
  * Add general HTML metadata extractor for title, META elements, LINK elements
  * Flexible command-line tool for easy testing (based on Jürgen's MetaX command line tool)
  * Move remaining documentation from Sindice Confluence and sindice.com to Wiki
  * Package each extractor with an example file (to document its typical input and output)
  * Add support for N-Quads output
  * Add support for archive input: ZIP, WARC, possibly ARC
