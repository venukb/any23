#summary What to expect in the next versions of Any23

= Version 0.1 =

The goal is to have an initial open-source release of the “RDFizer” component developed for Sindice. Focus is on getting the code in shape for publication, creating initial documentation, setting up the project infrastructure and so on. No work on features is planned.

= Version 0.2 =

The focus is on quality. For all core tasks, this version should be superior to what a developer could cobble together in a day or two, thus giving developers a good reason to use Any23.

    * Deliver results grouped by extractor/entity instead of one big RDF model
    * Allow choosing which extractors to use

  * Flexible command-line tool
